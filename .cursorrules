# uv-only Development Policy

To maintain consistency across development environments and avoid dependency conflicts, the following rules apply to this project:

- **NEVER use `pip`**. All package management MUST be done through `uv`.
- Use `uv add <package>` to install new libraries.
- Use `uv remove <package>` to uninstall libraries.
- Use `uv run <script>` to execute Python scripts within the project environment.
- Use `uv python install <version>` if a specific Python version is missing.
- When creating new projects, use `uv init`.

This policy ensures that all team members use the same deterministic environment.
